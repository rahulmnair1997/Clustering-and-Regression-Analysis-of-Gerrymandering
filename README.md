# Clustering and Regression Analysis of Gerrymandering
There are 2 parts to this project:
- Clustering
- Regression

### Clustering
The main goal with clustering was to create a plan in which we can get considerably compact districts maintaining good distribution of population across districts. For that, we chose weighted K-means clustering in which we use population to calculate weight which will be used to make the cluster have better population distribution. 

### Regression
We are taking the 2012 vtd grouped by County. We are predicting the proportion of a county that voted D in the 2012 presidential election (67 counties total). 
For that, we are using following regression techniques:
- Stepwise Regression 
- Best Subset Selection Regression 
- Multiple Linear Regression 
- XGBoost
- Ridge Regression 
- LASSO Regression 
- Random Forest
